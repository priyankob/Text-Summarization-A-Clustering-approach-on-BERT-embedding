# Text-Summarization-A-Clustering-approach-on-BERT-embedding
This is a low cost approach for text summarization through text embedding clustering.
The project was done during early 2022 , hence using BERT embedding for easy fine tuning
in low memory setup. Although summarization is the end goal - same clustering approach 
can be easily adopted for unsupervised disacourse tracking or social media analysis
