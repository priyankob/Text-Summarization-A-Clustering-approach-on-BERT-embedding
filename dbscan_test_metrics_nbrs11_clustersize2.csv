2," He credits the Clean Air Act with making Americans ""a lot"" healthier, in addition to being able to ""see the mountains in the background because they aren't covered in smog."" Peer-reviewed Environmental Protection Agency studies say that the Clean Air Act and subsequent amendments have reduced early deaths associated with exposure to ambient fine particle pollution and ozone, and reduced illnesses such as chronic bronchitis and acute myocardial infarction. In many ways, Obama is attempting to reframe the discussion around climate change as a public health issue that affects all of us, while conceding that we don't fully understand the magnitude of the correlation between rising temperatures and impact on human health. The Department of Energy estimates you can save up to 15% on your bill by turning off your thermostat when you're not at home. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit contend that the language of the Affordable Care Act does not allow for tax subsidies in those states (without state-based exchanges), possibly creating a situation, for example, in which people in Massachusetts would receive a tax credit, but people living in Texas would not.",Obama is attempting to reframe the discussion around climate change as a public health issue that affects all of us.

No wonder the research firm Latino Decisions reports that, ""We find no evidence that Rubio's candidacy will draw significant Latino support for his candidacy or for his party more generally.""

When Scott's brother Anthony saw the video, he was convinced Slager's account of what happened was not true, he told CNN. ""I didn't believe my brother would have done that anyway.""

37," Last Thursday, Jeff Courcelle came home from work to find 5-year-old Mocha -- a pure bred fawn-colored Doberman pincher -- hovering over a pile of screws, metal pieces, three watch heads and some chewed leather straps. The 80-pound Doberman, whom her owners describe as ""more goofy than scary,"" had pulled down a basket of wrist wear from a shelf in their bedroom and eaten nearly all the contents. The couple took her to the MSPCA's Angell Animal Medical Center, a 24-hour emergency and specialty hospital, where a veterinarian performed a 3-hour endoscopy to explore the contents of her belly. Mocha was a repeat offender: Just last summer, she got very sick and had to have emergency stomach surgery after a piece of plastic from an orange juice container perforated her intestine. The breeder told Parkinson that Dobermans are particularly known to get anxious and do these sort of things.","Mocha, 5, was a repeat offender.

The ruling Justice and Development Party ended up winning by a comfortable margin, but few Turks were reassured by the energy minister's explanation that the voting day black-outs were caused by a cat getting lost. The gunmen demanded the confessions of police officers accused of shooting a tear gas canister at Berkin Elvan, a 15-year-old boy who was critically wounded during anti-government protests that raged across Istanbul in 2013. Online and in the streets, some Turks began linking the massive electricity blackouts to the hostage-taking inside one of Turkey's best-protected buildings, even though there is little to suggest the two incidents are connected.","the government's increasingly heavy-handed repression of public dissent has contributed to a hyper-polarized and deeply mistrustful political atmosphere.

""He was there,"" defense attorney Judy Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. Chakravarty quoted Bill Richard, Martin's father, who earlier testified, ""I guess we were just unlucky that day."" During the 15-minute rebuttal period, prosecutor William Weinreb told jurors not to be distracted by the defense's ""attempt to point the finger at somebody else.""

The brothers allegedly killed the 26-year-old officier for his service weapon but couldn't pry it loose from a safety holster.
